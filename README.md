# Gocaine-xtajit
is a x86 code emulator for AArch64 Wine! But Sorry to say that we have to test it.

# How to use it
1, Copy 3 dlls in this repository named xtajit.dll, np21w_emu.dll and ULDllLoader.dll to System32 on AArch64 wine.

2, Copy and/or implement the Wine Wow64 modules for i386 apps compatibility to SysWOW64 folder in Windows folder.

3, Open the x86(i386 or IA-32 ABI) apps on the wine which installed Gocaine-xtajit.

4, You'll see the 32bit x86 apps works on Wine for AArch64!
